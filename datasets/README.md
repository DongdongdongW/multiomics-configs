# Datasets under study:

Datasets under study are divided into two different categories:

- differential-expression: label-free, or TMT. In differential expression datasets are analyzed completely.
- absolute-expression: Absolute expression is divided into cell-lines dataets, tissues and datasets are analyzed by Sample.

Some datasets are reuse between the two categories (differential-expression or absolute-expression) depending on the type of analysis performed.
