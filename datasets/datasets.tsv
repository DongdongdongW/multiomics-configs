"Clinical Data :ÊIt inculdes attributes like age, overall survival, phological stage (I, II, III, IV), TNM staging, Clinical subtype, Molecular Subtype, number of lymph nodes, radiation therapy."									
"Copy Number (Level: Focal, Gene) :ÊNormalized copy number (SNPs) ans Copy number alterations for aggregated/segmented regions, per sample"									
"miRNA (Leve: Gene, Isoform) :ÊNormalized signals per probe or probe set for each participant's tumor sample"									
"Mutation (Level: Site, Gene) :ÊMutation calls for each participant"									
"Methylation (Level: Gene) :ÊCalculated beta values mapped to genome, per sample"									
"RNAseq (Level: Gene) :ÊThe normalized expression signal of individual Gene (transcripts), per sample"									
"RPPA (Level: Analyte, Gene) :ÊNormalized protein expression for each gene, per sample"									
Proteomics (Level: Gene) :ÊAverage log-ratio of sample reporter-ion to common reference of peptide ions associated with the gene in acquisitions from a specific biological Sample (Unshared Log Ratio-Average log-ratio of sample reporter-ion to common reference of peptide ions of unshared peptides only associated with the gene in acquisitions from a specific biological sample).									
Phospho-Proteomics (Level: Site) :ÊAverage log-ratio of sample reporter-ion to common reference of peptide ions associated with phosphorylated site combinations in acquisitions from a specific biological sample (CDAP Protein Report).									
Glyco-Proteomics (Level: Site) :ÊAverage log-ratio of sample reporter-ion to common reference of peptide ions associated with deglycosylated N-glycosylation site combinations in acquisitions from a specific biological sample (CDAP Protein Report).
