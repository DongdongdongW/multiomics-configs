Investigation Title	In-depth proteome analysis of human ascites using high-pH peptide fractionation
Experiment Description	For in-depth profiling, ascites from patients with benign disease or gastric cancer were subjected to high-resolution mass spectromtery analysis. By high-pH peptide fractionation, 3481 protein groups were identified in 72 LC-MS/MS runs.

Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	First, we pooled samples from 3 individuals with benign disease and gastric cancer. Combined with immune-affinity depletion and High-pH peptide fractionation method, we mapped the global ascites proteome. In addition, High-pH peptide fractionation approach without immunoaffinity depletion step was applied as complementary strategies. Proteins obtained from ascites were digested by filter-aided sample preparation (FASP). All resulting peptides were acidified with 1% TFA and desalted using an OASIS C18 column. Peptides were fractionated by StageTip-based high-pH reversed-phase fractionation. The peptide samples were analyzed by online nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), consisting of an Easy-nLC 1000 and a Q-Exactive quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer.	For in-depth proteome profiling, raw files were processed in Proteome Discoverer ver 1.4 using the Sequest-HT and MSAmanda search engines against the Uniprot Human database (released August, 2016) including forward and reverse protein sequences.
