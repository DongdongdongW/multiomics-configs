Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD014458	P-MTAB-Data-PXD014458
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	The cell lines were obtained from ATCC and were cultured at 37 °C (5 % CO2) in the manufacturer’s recommended medium (MCF7 in EMEM, insulin 10 ug/mL, FBS 10 %; SKBR3 in McCoy 5A, FBS 10 %; MCF10 in DEMEM/F12 1:1, horse serum 5-10 %, EGF 20 ng/mL, hydrocortisone 0.5 ug/mL, cholera toxin 0.1 ug/mL, insulin 10 ug/mL ). The cells were arrested in serum/growth factor-free culture medium for 48 h, released for 24 h in medium/FBS (10 %) and growth factors, harvested, lysed (Sigma Cell Lytic NuCLEAR extraction kit), denatured at 55-60 °C for 1 h in urea (8 M) and DTT (4.5 mM), diluted 10-fold with NH4HCO3 (50 mM), and digested with trypsin overnight (substrate:enzyme ratio 30-50:1). All samples were cleaned with C18/SCX cartridges (Agilent SPEC-PTC18/SCX), and prepared at a concentration of 2 ug/uL in a solution of H2O/CH3CN (98:2, v/v)/TFA (0.01 %) for LC-MS/MS analysis. The samples were analyzed by nano-LC (12 cm x 100 um i.d. column, Zorbax C18 packing/5 um), 200 min gradient (solvent A 5 % CH3CN, solvent B 80 % CH3CN, TFA 0.01 %, gradient from 10 % to 90 % B), using an LTQ Thermo mass spectrometer and DDA analysis (MS range 500-2000 m/z, normalized collision energy 30-35 %, activation Q 0.25, activation time 30 ms, isolation width 3 m/z, tandem MS performed on top 5 most intense ions, +/-5 m/z zoom scan width, +/-1.5 m/z exclusion mass width, exclusion duration 60 s).	MS raw data were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4/Sequest HT by using a UniProt Homo sapiens database (reviewed, non-redundant, 20,198 entries, January 2015 download). MS database search parameters included: 500-5000 precursor mass range, min/max peptide length 6/144, S/N threshold 1.5, precursor ion tolerance 2 Da, fragment ion tolerance 1 Da, fully tryptic fragments, 2 missed cleavages allowed, b/y/a ions, no PTMs, and peptide stringent FDR 1 % and relaxed FDR 3 %. Peptide mutations were identified by searching the raw files (the tandem mass spectra that could not be matched to the canonical Homo sapiens database) against the XMAn-v1 database of mutated peptides (Yang. X; Lazar I.M., XMAn: A Homo sapiens mutated-peptide database for the MS analysis of cancerous cell states, J. Proteome Res. 2014, 13, 5486-5495).
