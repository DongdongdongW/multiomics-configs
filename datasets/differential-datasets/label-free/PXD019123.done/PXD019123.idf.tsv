Investigation Title	Proteome profilling of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas
Experiment Description	LC-MS/MS based proteomics study of chromophobe renal cell carcinomas versus the adjacent healthy kidney tissues, nine patients included. The chromophobe renal cell carcinoma cells (UOK276) under different conditions were also analyzed.

Date of Experiment	2020-05-12
Public Release Date	2020-07-23

Protocol Name	P-MTAB-Sample-PXD019123	P-MTAB-Data-PXD019123
Protocol Type	sample collection protocol	data analysis protocol
Protocol Description	Tissues were homogenized and the sample processing was done with the iST kit according to the instruction from PreOmics. Proteomic profiling of the UOK276 cells was performed as reported previously (PMCID:PMC5739687) in biological triplicates.	Raw MS data were processed with MaxQuant software with the Andromeda search engine. A false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.01 for proteins, peptides and spectra was applied.
