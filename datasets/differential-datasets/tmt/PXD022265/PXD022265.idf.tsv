Investigation Title	Plasma proteomics to discover diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease
Experiment Description	The project aims to find diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease in plasma. We applied discovery based proteomics was used to detect changes in proteins due to Alzheimer's disease using plasma samples collected from four study groups (African American Alzheimer's disease & cognitively normal, non-Hispanic-White Alzheimer's disease & cognitively normal). The data emphesizes the need for inclusion in Alzheimer's disease research.

Protocol Description	Plasma samples were immunodepleted and digested using trypsin/Lys-C mix. Resulting peptides were labeled using TMT tags and fractionated using high pH fractionation. Each fraction was analyzed by LC-MS/MS & MS3 on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer.	Raw files were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer software (version 2.2) and searched against the Uniprot human reviewed protein database (07/17/2018, 20289 sequences) using SEQUEST-HT. The following parameters were used: maximum two trypsin miscleavages, precursor mass tolerance 10 ppm, fragment mass tolerance 0.6 Da; dynamic modification of methionine oxidation (+15.995 Da), protein N-termini acetyl (42.011 Da), TMT 10 (229.163 Da)/11 plex (229.169 Da) on peptide N-termini and lysine residue, static modification of cysteine carbamidomethyl (+57.02 Da). Decoy database searching was employed to generate high confidence peptides (FDR < 1%). TMT reporter ions (i.e. m/z 126 â€“ 131) were identified with the following parameters: most confident centroid and 20 ppm for reporter ion mass tolerance.
